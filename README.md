# espionage-bot

A Discord bot that plays the Nokia Espionage ringtone for any user entering the AFK channel.

The bot can also be summoned manually using `!espionage`.

## Usage

Create `.env` and set your bot token and MP3 file path there.

Install the project with `pipenv install`. Run `start.py` inside the virtual environment.

Refer to the discord-py installation guide for other dependencies, e.g. on Linux.

The bot should at least have the `Connect`, `Speak`, `Mute Members` and `Move Members` permissions.
